## Pipeline of data analysis

### Input files: 
- VCF file of genotype
- Z-score file generated by ImpG software
- Phenotype file

### Process:
- USE ANNO to annotate for all alleles
- Generate a mapping file with SNP_id and region_id based on annotation file
- Extract alleles in mapping file to generate FRQ file, raw genotype file, REF and ALT alleles must be specified
