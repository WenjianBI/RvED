## Pipeline of data analysis

### Input files: 
- VCF file of genotype
- Z-score file generated by ImpG software
- Phenotype file

### Process:
- USE ANNOVAR (http://annovar.openbioinformatics.org/en/latest/) to annotate all alleles
- Generate a mapping file with SNP_id and region_id based on annotation file
- Extract alleles in mapping file to generate FRQ file, raw genotype file, REF and ALT alleles must be specified

### Useful code:
- step-5-QC_rsq_0.3 remove imputated variants whose R-sq less than 0.3 and maf greater than 0.05
